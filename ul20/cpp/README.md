Intel Edison has a Linux (Yocto) inside. We are using this for running c++ program and the mraa library which is awesome to access analogic and digital pins from Eclipse (IDE c++).
* First and foremost the setup of your Eclipse environment is explained in this [getting started guide] (https://software.intel.com/iot/library/edison-getting-started)
* Access your Edison via SSH (your laptop and the board should be connected to same WIFI network ).
```
ssh root@your_edison_ip
```
* Now we must ensure that the curl library is linked in our proyect (We need it for sending HTTP requests). If you get compiler errors, follow the instructions below in order to add the curl library:
```
Right click on the project and select properties. Then navigate to C/C++ Build -->Settings --> Cross G++ Linker --> Libraries --> Click the green plus button,and add the “curl” library.
```
```
 Add the path of the curl library.
```
* Configure your FIWARE credentials:
```
string FIWARE_APIKEY = "xxxxx";
```
* Choose your Edison for the boards available list. If your device is not displayed in the list, select "Enable broadcast target search".
* Please make sure that you've already plugged  the light sensor into A0 analog input and the button sensor into A1.
* Compile the .cpp file clicking on the "hammer button".
* Upload and run the .cpp to your Edison clicking on the  green play button. Now your Edison is reading sensors and its data is updated in the FIWARE IoT Stack! 
* Next steps: Read the data from you application using NGSI APIs or show it in a cool Freeboard as explained in [Visualizing your FIWARE IoT Stack Data](http://emtech-hackathon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickguide/index.html#step-4-show-in-a-dashboard)


* compile file 
```
g++ -lcurl -lmraa main.cpp -o main
```

* run 
```
./main 
```
